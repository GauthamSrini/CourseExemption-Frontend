# 🎓Course Exemption Automation

Our goal is to overhaul the existing course exemption procedure by implementing a streamlined, user-centric system. This new platform not only simplifies the application process but also enhances tracking and approval workflows. By leveraging modern technologies, we ensure a reliable and scalable solution that meets the needs of students and administrators alike. 📈📋
